Hi! My name is Heiloi, but most people just call me Louie. I am currently a PhD Student at Newcastle University looking into active vision in bumblebees.  

{{< figure src="/images/PXL_20241112_120400209.PORTRAIT.jpg" title="Picture of me at the Francis Crick Institute!" width="600" >}}

My academic journey began at Imperial College London, where I got a Bachelor's in Biology and Master's in Bioinformatics. After that, I was a research assistant at the Francis Crick Institute, where I worked with a neurophysiology lab to investigate multisensory coding in mice brains! 

Some of my interests include:
* Entomology
* Beekeeping
* Programming
* Drawing (mostly bugs and rough sketches)
* Cooking
