the past few weeks have been an absolute shitshow. 

[last sunday my house burned down.](https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/25141807.newcastle-student-accommodation-evacuated-flat-fire/)

well that's not true, first it's a student accommodation, and secondly the fire only appeared on the top floor and thankfully didnt consume the whole building. 

but the damage was bad enough that we had to be relocated to temporary accommodation, where i was placed in some dingy hostel. 

we weren't even allowed back into our rooms to collect stuff until a few days after, so all i had with me since evacuating was my phone and wallet. thank god i brought those things otherwise i would have no money and no one to contact. 

and more recently we've been told that we won't be coming back to our rooms for the rest of the year, which makes me effectively homeless. 

suddenly i'm having to find a place for me to live in, at least until the next academic year. 

all of this going on while my experiments are just starting and my first year exams are fast approaching. 

of all the challenges i was expecting to encounter in my phd, this was not one of them. i was not prepared for this. 

now closing in on a short-term tenancy takeover, hoping this goes well because i don't know how much more of this i can take, financially and mentally.
