      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking long and hard about the topic of my first ever post on my personal website, long enough to the point I&amp;rsquo;ve also contemplated when I should actually begin releasing content. Knowing that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bee_Day&#34;&gt;World Bee Day&lt;/a&gt; is coming up (celebrated on the 20th of May every year), I figured that I would explain to you all how it all started: &lt;em&gt;how I got into bees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It all began back when I was still studying for my bachelors degree at Imperial College London. I had joined a student-led society that did gardening as group activities, and indeed they had a quaint but decently-sized allotment in the middle of the South Kensington campus. Within this little retreat from the bustling Exhibition Road were two bee hives, kept and maintained by the society&amp;rsquo;s own committee members. I had a lot of fun in every gardening session I joined, and I even got a chance to attend a &amp;lsquo;hive tour&amp;rsquo; and saw the inside of a hive for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
